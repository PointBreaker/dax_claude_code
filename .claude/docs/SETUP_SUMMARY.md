# Claude Code Configuration Setup Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-15

## What Was Fixed

### Problem
The `.claude/` configuration was set up with complex multi-step workflow orchestration in `commands.json` that didn't match how Claude Code actually works. Agents couldn't be properly invoked, and the memory bank system referenced in CLAUDE.md didn't exist.

### Solution
Restructured the entire configuration to align with Claude Code's actual capabilities:

1. **Slash Commands**: Created proper markdown files in `.claude/commands/`
2. **Agent Descriptions**: Simplified agent frontmatter for clarity
3. **Memory Bank**: Initialized all CLAUDE-*.md files
4. **Reference Guide**: Converted commands.json to documentation

## How It Works Now

### Slash Commands

Users can type these commands in Claude Code:

- **`/plan`** - Plan new features with agent collaboration
- **`/develop`** - Execute implementation based on spec
- **`/debug`** - Systematic debugging with full context
- **`/analyze`** - Two-layer analysis (docs + code)
- **`/quick-dev`** - Fast simple changes without full planning

Each command is a markdown file that expands to a detailed prompt template.

### Agent System

Five specialized agents handle different aspects:

1. **spec-driven-planner**
   - Planning and specification generation
   - Requirements analysis with reflection
   - Bug triage and patch planning

2. **doc-analysis**
   - Analyzes ./project_docs directory (6 files)
   - Provides architectural context and design rationale
   - Explains "why" behind decisions

3. **code-searcher**
   - Locates code with exact file paths and line numbers
   - Forensic analysis and pattern detection
   - Chain of Draft (CoD) mode for efficient large-scale searches
   - Fills documentation gaps with implementation details

4. **fullstack-dev**
   - End-to-end implementation for Django/DRF + Vue 3 + MySQL
   - Handles backend, frontend, database, and Docker ops
   - Produces complete implementations with tests

5. **memory-bank-synchronizer**
   - Maintains consistency between memory bank and codebase
   - Updates patterns, decisions, and implementation status
   - Preserves strategic planning and historical context

### Two-Layer Analysis

For comprehensive understanding, use both agents:

```
User Question
    ↓
doc-analysis → Architectural context from ./project_docs
    ↓
code-searcher → Actual implementation from source code
    ↓
Combined Answer → Complete understanding with citations
```

### Memory Bank System

Structured context files for session continuity:

- **CLAUDE.md** - Main guidance (always read automatically)
- **CLAUDE-activeContext.md** - Current work state (check first!)
- **CLAUDE-patterns.md** - Established code patterns
- **CLAUDE-decisions.md** - Architecture decisions with rationale
- **CLAUDE-troubleshooting.md** - Issue solutions database
- **CLAUDE-config-variables.md** - Configuration reference
- **CLAUDE-temp.md** - Temporary scratch pad

---

## Usage Examples

### Starting a New Feature

```
User: "I want to build an inventory management system"
Claude: Reads CLAUDE-activeContext.md, then decides to delegate
        Uses /plan or invokes agents directly:
        1. doc-analysis for existing patterns
        2. code-searcher for integration points
        3. Generates spec
        4. memory-bank-synchronizer records it
```

### Fixing a Bug

```
User: "/debug Login page throws 500 error on submit"
Command expands to debugging workflow:
        1. Loads CLAUDE-troubleshooting.md
        2. doc-analysis checks expected behavior
        3. code-searcher locates problematic code
        4. Generates fix plan with line numbers
        5. memory-bank-synchronizer records solution
```

### Understanding System

```
User: "/analyze How does file classification work?"
Command triggers two-layer analysis:
        1. doc-analysis extracts from 04-FILE_CLASSIFICATION.md
        2. code-searcher finds actual implementation
        3. Synthesizes complete answer
        4. memory-bank-synchronizer stores knowledge
```

## Key Improvements

### Before
❌ Complex commands.json with multi-step workflows that don't execute
❌ No actual slash command files
❌ Missing memory bank files referenced in CLAUDE.md
❌ Verbose agent descriptions that waste tokens
❌ No clear invocation model for agents

### After
✅ Simple markdown slash commands that work
✅ commands.json serves as reference guide
✅ Complete memory bank system initialized
✅ Concise, clear agent descriptions
✅ Clear agent invocation model documented

---

## Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Start sessions** by checking CLAUDE-activeContext.md context
2. **Use slash commands** for common workflows
3. **Ask naturally** - main agent decides best approach
4. **Check troubleshooting** before reporting issues

### For Main Agent (Claude)

1. **Read CLAUDE-activeContext.md** at session start
2. **Delegate intelligently** - not every task needs a sub-agent
3. **Provide complete context** when invoking agents
4. **Update memory bank** after significant work
5. **Use two-layer analysis** for comprehensive understanding

### For Agent Invocation

```markdown
✅ Good Invocation:
"Analyze the authentication system. Context: Django/DRF backend
with JWT tokens. Look for login endpoint in backend/auth/ directory.
Check for security vulnerabilities. Return: code locations with line
numbers, security assessment, and recommendations."

❌ Bad Invocation:
"Find auth code"
(Too vague, missing context, unclear expectations)
```

## Testing the Setup

### Verify Slash Commands

In Claude Code, type `/` and you should see:
- /plan
- /develop
- /debug
- /analyze
- /quick-dev

### Verify Agents

Main agent should be able to invoke:
- Task(subagent_type: "doc-analysis", prompt: "...")
- Task(subagent_type: "code-searcher", prompt: "...")
- Task(subagent_type: "fullstack-dev", prompt: "...")
- Task(subagent_type: "memory-bank-synchronizer", prompt: "...")
- Task(subagent_type: "spec-driven-planner", prompt: "...")

### Verify Memory Bank

All files should exist and be readable:
```bash
ls -la CLAUDE*.md
# Should show all 7 files
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Slash commands not showing?
- Check `.claude/commands/*.md` files exist
- Verify frontmatter has `description` field
- Restart Claude Code or reload window

### Agents not being invoked?
- Main agent decides when delegation is needed
- Provide clear context in your request
- Check agent descriptions are correct

### Memory bank errors?
- Ensure all CLAUDE-*.md files exist
- Check file permissions
- Initialize from templates if corrupted

### Two-layer analysis not working?
- Verify ./project_docs/ directory exists
- Ensure 6 core doc files present
- Check agent can read files

---

## Next Steps

1. **Test the system** with real workflows
2. **Refine prompts** based on usage
3. **Add project-specific context** to memory bank files
4. **Update troubleshooting** as issues are resolved
5. **Evolve patterns** as codebase grows
